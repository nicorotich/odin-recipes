        <h2>Description</h2>
            <p>This is my mom's special homemade lasagna recipe with a meaty, made-from-scratch tomato sauce and a deliciously cheesy filling.
            A more traditional homemade lasagna filling would be made with ricotta but my mom's recipe calls for a blend of small-curd cottage 
            cheese and Parmesan. I have found none better anywhere. Serve with a leafy green salad and crusty garlic bread.</p>

        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
            <p>These are the ingredients you'll need to make this top-rated homemade lasagna recipe:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Meat:</strong> This lasagna recipe starts with a pound of ground meat (½ pound ground pork, ½ pound lean ground beef).</li>
                <li><strong>Onion:</strong> A diced onion is cooked until translucent with the ground meat.</li>
                <li><strong>Canned tomatoes:</strong> You'll need a can of tomato sauce and a can of crushed tomatoes.</li>
                <li><strong>Fresh herbs:</strong> For fresh flavor, chop two tablespoons of parsley and crush one clove of garlic.</li>
                <li><strong>Sugar:</strong> A dash of sugar balances out all of the acidity from the tomatoes.</li>
                <li><strong>Spices and seasonings:</strong> This homemade lasagna is seasoned with dried basil, dried oregano, salt, and black pepper.</li>
                <li><strong>Noodles:</strong> Of course, you'll need lasagna noodles! This recipe calls for uncooked noodles, but you can use the oven-ready variety to save time.</li>
                <li><strong>Cheese:</strong> The cheese layer is made up of cottage cheese and Parmesan. You'll also need shredded mozzarella.</li>
                <li><strong>Eggs:</strong> Eggs make the cheese layer extra creamy. Plus, they act as a binding agent (which means they hold the layer together).</li>
            </ul>

        <h3>Recipe</h3>
            <p>Making homemade lasagna much easier than it looks. You'll find the full, step-by-step recipe below </p>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>Step 1</strong>
                    <p>Combine pork and ground beef in a large, deep skillet over medium-high heat; 
                        cook and stir until browned and crumbly, 5 to 7 minutes. Add onion and cook until translucent,
                        about 5 minutes.</p>
                </li>
                <li><strong>Step 2</strong>
                    <p>Stir in crushed tomatoes, tomato sauce, 1 tablespoon fresh parsley, garlic, basil, salt, oregano, and sugar.
                        Reduce heat to medium-low and simmer, stirring occasionally, for 30 minutes.</p>
                </li>
                <li><strong>Step 3</strong>
                    <p>While the sauce is simmering, bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil.
                        Cook lasagna noodles in the boiling water, stirring occasionally,
                        until tender yet firm to the bite, 8 to 10 minutes. Drain and set aside.</p>
                </li>
                <li><strong>Step 4</strong>
                    <p>While the noodles are cooking, preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).</p>
                </li>
                <li><strong>Step 5</strong>
                    <p>Mix cottage cheese, Parmesan cheese, eggs, remaining 1 tablespoon fresh parsley, salt
                         and pepper in a large bowl until combined.</p>
                </li>
                <li><strong>Step 6</strong>
                    <p>Assemble lasagna: Spread a spoon or two of sauce over the bottom of a 9x13-inch baking dish just to to coat it.
                        Place two layers of noodles over the sauce to cover. Layer with 1/2 of the cheese mixture, 1/2 of the remaining sauce,
                        and 1/2 of the mozzarella cheese. Repeat layers once more using the remaining noodles, cheese mixture, sauce, and mozzarella.
                        Cover the baking dish with aluminum foil.</p>
                </li>
                <li><strong>Step 7</strong>
                    <p>Bake in the preheated oven for 30 to 40 minutes. Remove the foil and bake until cheese is golden brown, 5 to 10 more minutes.</p>
                </li>
                <li><strong>Step 8</strong>
                    <p>Remove from the oven and let stand for 10 minutes before cutting and serving.</p>
                </li>
